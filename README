📌 Linux Process Simulation
This repository contains assignments that simulate core operating system concepts using Python.

Assignment 1: Linux Process Management
Tasks
Create processes using os.fork().
Execute system commands with os.execvp().
Demonstrate zombie and orphan processes.
Inspect process details from /proc/[pid].
Assign process priorities using os.nice().
Assignment 2: System Startup Simulation
Simulates a simplified system startup using the multiprocessing and logging modules.
Creates multiple child processes, runs dummy tasks, and logs lifecycle events.
Generates a log file: process_log.txt.
Assignment 3: Scheduling
Implements CPU scheduling algorithms in Python.

Algorithms Implemented
First Come First Serve (FCFS): Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
Shortest Job First (SJF): Process with the shortest burst time is scheduled first.
Round Robin (RR): Each process gets a fixed time quantum in cyclic order.
Metrics Calculated
Waiting Time
Turnaround Time
Average Waiting Time
Average Turnaround Time
Comparison
SJF: Gives the lowest average waiting and turnaround time, but may cause starvation of long processes.

FCFS: Simple but can lead to the convoy effect if a long job arrives first.

Round Robin: Ensures fairness (all processes get CPU time), but performance depends on the time quantum chosen.

Assignment 3: Memory Allocation Strategies
Simulates different memory allocation strategies in an operating system.

Algorithms Implemented
First Fit: Allocates the first block that is large enough for the process.
Best Fit: Allocates the smallest block that is large enough to minimize waste.
Worst Fit: Allocates the largest available block to reduce future fragmentation.
Metrics Observed
Process allocation success or failure.
Block utilization after allocation.
